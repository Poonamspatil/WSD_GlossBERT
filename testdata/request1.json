I believed in James Baldwin’s injunction: If we…like lovers, insist on, or create, the consciousness of the others,…we may be able…to end the racial nightmare, and achieve our country, and change the history of the world. And I felt I knew what Baldwin asked from me: reparation that required my whole body, my whole being. It is the innocence which constitutes the crime, Baldwin wrote of whites in 1963. For these innocent people have no other hope. They are, in effect, still trapped in a history which they do not understand; and until they understand it, they cannot be released from it. Yes, I told myself, I would prove that I was no innocent—Baldwin’s softer, and more damning, term for ignorance. Teaching in Helena, Arkansas, a rural town located in the heart of the Delta, might help acquit me of Baldwin’s charge.","dictionaryData":[{"id":5949,"word_id":1206,"fl":"adjective","meaning":"causing or leading to one's own condemnation or ruin","count":1,"isTeacher":1,"isUser":1},{"id":5948,"word_id":1206,"fl":"verb","meaning":"to condemn to a punishment or fate; especially : to condemn to hell","count":0,"isTeacher":null,"isUser":0},{"id":3476,"word_id":1206,"fl":"verb","meaning":"—used to show that you are angry or annoyed at a person, thing, or situation","count":0,"isTeacher":null,"isUser":0},{"id":3477,"word_id":1206,"fl":"combining ","meaning":"yourself or itself","count":0,"isTeacher":null,"isUser":0},{"id":5947,"word_id":1206,"fl":"adjective","meaning":"bringing damnation","count":0,"isTeacher":null,"isUser":0}]},{"word":"attributed","sentence":"Growing up, I’d attributed to my mother and father a particular hysteria, a sad misapprehension of America, where I—unlike them—was born, and belonged.

Phillips County, of which Helena is the seat, was one of the poorest counties in the country, and ranked last in the state of Arkansas in public health.

Children respected parents; parents respected education. According to Ms. Riley, integration had ruined a lot of it. Black teachers, generally not welcome to teach at newly integrated white schools, lost jobs, while white teachers kept theirs. When Central integrated, administrators began to offer alternatives to paddling, because they didn’t want the few black teachers who’d found jobs to whip a white child.
